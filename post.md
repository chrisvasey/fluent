### We want to build apps fast.

Building apps takes a long time.
Once you know roughly what you are building and you have ideas around how an app can acheive something, you next sit down and work out how.
You work out what pages you need, then what functionality each page needs.
Maybe like us, you break that functioanlity down into components.

These components are the most important part of your app, it is how your idea interacts with real world people. The thinking that goes into them is often key to making or breaking whatever you are building.
Sadly, making these components is often hard, maybe not always technically but the time and mental load needed to make them real can really take away from the overall time spent on a project.

At Kindred, Jess and I love solving the problems.
We want to research, discuss, draw and evaluate ideas.
We notice this is something that normally has to be done quickly, afterall we are being paid to build things for are customers, not just think about everything.

We found that the time it takes from an idea to testing it can sometimes harm the idea. The faster you can suggest a way forward and test it, the faster you learn what the "best" idea is.

Early in my career, building apps and websites, I come to a realisation that most apps share a LOT of functionality.
Go between a few of the apps you use everyday and you will very quickly see how most apps are very similar.

Almost all apps need:
    * Login, account creation, password reset and other authentication
    * User profile - Editing name, profile picture etc, password reset and account delation
    * Account subscriptions, in app purchases, billing history etc
    * Layouts for components.
    * Pages that only display user generated content (terms, about pages, docs, marketing pages)

And this is before you even get to the back office parts of an app like metrics dashboards, user managment, audit logging etc.
